# Movie-Recommendation-System
This is a simple movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. The system is built using Python and utilizes the bag-of-words algorithm and cosine similarity model for machine learning.

## How it Works
The recommendation system uses content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid filtering techniques to generate recommendations. The bag-of-words algorithm is used to represent movie plots as a vector of words, and the cosine similarity model is used to measure the similarity between movie plots.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the IMDb dataset, which contains information on movies and TV shows.

## Setup
To run the recommendation system, you'll need Python 3.x and the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
sklearn
streamlit

## Usage
To use the recommendation system, simply run the "streamlit run main.py" in cmd. The system will prompt the user to input their movie preferences, and then generate a list of recommended movies.

## Conclusion
This movie recommendation system is a simple example of how machine learning can be used to personalize user experiences. It can be improved and scaled for larger datasets, and can be applied to other industries such as e-commerce and music streaming
