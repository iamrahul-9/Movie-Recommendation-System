# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies similar to a selected movie based on textual metadata.  
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and similarity measures to generate recommendations.

---

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how a recommendation system can be built using movie content instead of user ratings or viewing history.  
It focuses on text vectorization and similarity-based recommendations in a simple and explainable way.

---

## Recommendation Approach
- Type: Content-Based Filtering  
- Data Used: Movie metadata such as overview, genres, cast, and crew  
- Not Used: User ratings, user behavior, or collaborative filtering  

Recommendations are generated by comparing movie content rather than user preferences.

---

## Machine Learning / Algorithms Used

### Text Representation
- Technique: Bag of Words  
- Tool: CountVectorizer (scikit-learn)  
- Converts movie text data into numerical vectors based on word frequency

### Similarity Measurement
- Metric: Cosine Similarity  
- Measures how similar two movies are based on their vector representation

Movies with the highest cosine similarity scores are recommended.

---

## How It Works
1. Movie metadata is loaded and cleaned  
2. Relevant text features are combined into a single text field  
3. Text is converted into numerical vectors using Bag of Words  
4. Cosine similarity is calculated between all movies  
5. The system returns the top 5 most similar movies

Note:  
The dataset is not included in this repository due to GitHub file size limitations.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Streamlit  
- Pickle  

---

## Setup
Make sure Python 3.x is installed.

Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install streamlit pickle
```

Usage
Run the following command in the project directory:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

---

The application will prompt the user to enter a movie name and display the top 5 recommended movies.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how content-based recommendation systems work using NLP and similarity measures.
It provides a strong foundation for extending into more advanced systems such as collaborative or hybrid recommendation engines.
